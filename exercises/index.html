      <article>
        <h3>1: Warm Up</h3>
        <section>
          <p>Prime the ol' brain-pump with some basic HTML/CSS.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>See the link to the exercise page above?  Go ahead and open the exercise page up in Chrome. <em>Behold the beauty.</em></li>
            <li>Now, open the page up in your text editor.  We're going to make it <em>even more</em> magnificent.</li>
            <li>In general, the important styles for the exercise are in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the page.  Do you see it?</li>
            <li>Ok, let's edit.  Change the <code>color</code> of the <code>h1</code> to make it more subtle.  Try <code>#333333</code> if you like. Save the file, then switch back to Chrome and reload the page to view the changes.</li>
            <li>The paragraph text is too small.  Back to your editor again to increase the <code>font-size</code>.  Try <code>12px</code> or <code>14px</code>.  (Or <code>13px</code> if you aren't superstitious).  Again, save the changes, switch back the Chrome and reload the page to view the changes.  How is it lookin'?</li>
            <li>Now we'll spruce up the layout a little.  Let's make this a "fixed-width" layout by setting the <code>body</code> <code>width</code> to <code>800px</code>. Save and refresh.</li>
            <li>Stuck on anything?  You can always take a look at the completed exercise from the other link above.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Already twiddling your thumbs? Try these extra credit warm-ups.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Add another paragraph and give it a <code>class</code> of your choosing. Then, add style rules for this class that center the text, add a border, a little padding, and a tasteful background color.</li>
            <li>Add an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag after the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> with a few paragraphs in it.  Using CSS floats, make <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> side-by-side columns.</li>
          </ol>

        <h3>2: A Basic Layout</h3>
        <section>
          <p>Start by examining a simple fixed layout and then make it fluid using percentage-based widths.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>First, open up the page in Chrome and examine it with the dev tools, using the Elements pane with the Styles tab to see what is happening.  Why is <code>&lt;main&lt;</code> next to <code>&lt;aside</code>?</li>
            <li>Turn on Device mode.  Pick a few devices and see what happens to the layout.  Each time you change the device, you may (If you can't fit the device screen on your laptop's screen, enable the "fit" checkbox below the device model dropdown.)</li>
            <li>Using the dev tools, find where the <code>&lt;main&lt;</code>'s width is set.  Edit the width in-place.</li>
            <li>Reload the page to obliterate the temporary changes you made in the dev tools and return to viewing the saved CSS.</li>
            <li>The simplest way to make a layout more responsive is to set all your widths in percentages.  Using the dev tools, change the widths of <code>&lt;main&lt;</code> and <code>&lt;aside&lt;</code> to <code>70%</code> and <code>30%</code>, respectively.</li>
            <li>Whoops! Something ain't right.  Turns out, in addition to width, we have some margin infecting our layout.  Let's go ahead and make the margin fluid as well, and subtract it from the width of <code>&lt;main&lt;</code>.  In dev tools, make it's  <code>width: 68%</code> and <code>margin-right: 2%</code>.</li>
            <li>Now, go through a few devices (or drag the viewport handles) and see how the layout behaves.  Turn off device-mode to see how it looks full-width.</li>
            <li>Congratulate yourself for making a responsive layout!  Ok, maybe it's responsive "lite".  Baby steps!</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Extra Credit</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Add a third column before or after. Add styles to make them all fit nicely with percentage-based widths!</li>
            <li>Do you know about absolute positioning (TODO: link to tutorial or MDN)?  If you do, try removing the <code>float: left</code> from <code>&lt;aside&lt;</code> and using absolute positioning to place it to the right of <code>&lt;main&lt;</code>.</li>
          </ol>

        <h3>3: Baby's First Media Query</h3>
        <section>
          <p>Add a simple media query to an otherwise unassuming fluid layout.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Open up the exercise page in Chrome - should look familiar!  Turn on device-mode and pick a device.  This layout needs some love at narrower screens! </li>
            <li>Drag the viewport width handle around.  Around what width does it look too skinny? <input type="number" min="50" max="1000" step="50"/>  This is the "breakpoint" we want to target for some different styling.</li>
            <li>Open the page up in your editor.  Below the other styles, add a media query block that targets screens that are as wide as or narrower than the breakpoint you found above.  It should look like <code>@media screen and (max-width: BREAKPOINT_IN_PX){ ... }</code>.</li>
            <li>Any styles within this block will only be applied to narrower screens.  To see the effect, add a style rule within the media query block that changes the background color of <code>&lt;main&lt;</code> to "purple". Save the changes in your editor, reload the page in Chrome and drag the viewport width around. <em>Isn't it pretty?</em></li>
            <li>Nice! That was utterly useless.  What we'd like to do is change the layout for those narrower screens.  Let's make <code>&lt;main&lt;</code> and <code>&lt;aside&lt;</code> full-width instead of columns.  In your editor, within your new media query, set their widths to "100%". Save, reload the page and behold!</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Following along with Pete as we reorganize our CSS to treat small screens as first-class citizens.</p>
