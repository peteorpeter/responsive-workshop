      <h1>Responsive Design Exercises</h1>
      <article>
        <h3>1: Warm Up</h3>
        <section>
          <p>Prime the ol' brain-pump with some basic HTML/CSS.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>See the link to the exercise page above?  Go ahead and open the exercise page up in Chrome. <em>Behold the beauty.</em></li>
            <li>Now, open the page up in your text editor.  We're going to make it <em>even more</em> magnificent.</li>
            <li>In general, the important styles for the exercise are in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the page.  Do you see it?</li>
            <li>Ok, let's edit.  Change the <code>color</code> of the <code>h1</code> to make it more subtle.  Try <code>#333333</code> if you like. Save the file, then switch back to Chrome and reload the page to view the changes.</li>
            <li>The paragraph text is too small.  Back to your editor again to increase the <code>font-size</code>.  Try <code>12px</code> or <code>14px</code>.  (Or <code>13px</code> if you aren't superstitious).  Again, save the changes, switch back the Chrome and reload the page to view the changes.  How is it lookin'?</li>
            <li>Now we'll spruce up the layout a little.  Let's make this a "fixed-width" layout by setting the <code>body</code> <code>width</code> to <code>800px</code>. Save and refresh.</li>
            <li>Stuck on anything?  You can always take a look at the completed exercise from the other link above.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Already twiddling your thumbs? Try these extra credit warm-ups.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Add another paragraph and give it a <code>class</code> of your choosing. Then, add style rules for this class that center the text, add a border, a little padding, and a tasteful background color.</li>
            <li>Add an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag after the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> with a few paragraphs in it.  Using CSS floats, make <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> side-by-side columns.</li>
          </ol>

        <h3>2: A Basic Layout</h3>
        <section>
          <p>Start by examining a simple fixed layout and then make it fluid using percentage-based widths.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>First, open up the page in Chrome and examine it with the dev tools, using the Elements pane with the Styles tab to see what is happening.  Why is <code>&lt;main&lt;</code> next to <code>&lt;aside</code>?</li>
            <li>Turn on Device mode.  Pick a few devices and see what happens to the layout.  Each time you change the device, you may need to reload the page.  (If you can't fit the device screen on your laptop's screen, enable the "fit" checkbox below the device model dropdown.)</li>
            <li>Using the dev tools, find where the <code>&lt;main&lt;</code>'s width is set.  Edit the width in-place.</li>
            <li>Reload the page to obliterate the temporary changes you made in the dev tools and return to viewing the saved CSS.</li>
            <li>Note the fat, round cursor - the better to simulate fat fingers!</li>
            <li>The simplest way to make a layout more responsive is to set all your widths in percentages.  Using the dev tools, change the widths of <code>&lt;main&lt;</code> and <code>&lt;aside&lt;</code> to <code>70%</code> and <code>30%</code>, respectively.</li>
            <li>Whoops! Something ain't right.  Turns out, in addition to width, we have some margin infecting our layout.  Let's go ahead and make the margin fluid as well, and subtract it from the width of <code>&lt;main&lt;</code>.  In dev tools, make it's  <code>width: 68%</code> and <code>margin-right: 2%</code>.</li>
            <li>Now, go through a few devices (or drag the viewport handles) and see how the layout behaves.  Turn off device-mode to see how it looks full-width.</li>
            <li>Congratulate yourself for making a responsive layout!  Ok, maybe it's responsive "lite".  Baby steps!</li>
          </ol>

        <section>
          <p>Extra Credit</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Add a third column before or after. Add styles to make them all fit nicely with percentage-based widths!</li>
            <li>Do you know about absolute positioning (TODO: link to tutorial or MDN)?  If you do, try removing the <code>float: left</code> from <code>&lt;aside&lt;</code> and using absolute positioning to place it to the right of <code>&lt;main&lt;</code>.</li>
          </ol>

        <h3>3: Baby's First Media Query</h3>
        <section>
          <p>Add a simple media query to an otherwise unassuming fluid layout.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Open up the exercise page in Chrome - should look familiar!  Turn on device-mode and pick a device.  This layout needs some love at narrower screens! </li>
            <li>Drag the viewport width handle around.  Around what width does it look too skinny? <input type="number" min="50" max="1000" step="50"/>  This is the "breakpoint" we want to target for some different styling.</li>
            <li>Open the page up in your editor.  Below the other styles, add a media query block that targets screens that are as wide as or narrower than the breakpoint you found above.  It should look like <code>@media screen and (max-width: BREAKPOINT_IN_PX){ ... }</code>.</li>
            <li>Any styles within this block will only be applied to narrower screens.  To see the effect, add a style rule within the media query block that changes the background color of <code>&lt;main&lt;</code> to "purple". Save the changes in your editor, reload the page in Chrome and drag the viewport width around. <em>Isn't it pretty?</em></li>
            <li>Nice! That was utterly useless.  What we'd like to do is change the layout for those narrower screens.  Let's make <code>&lt;main&lt;</code> and <code>&lt;aside&lt;</code> full-width instead of columns.  In your editor, within your new media query, set their widths to "100%". Save, reload the page and behold!</li>

        <h3>6: Adjustable grids</h3>
        <section>
          <p>Take a simple, crude grid layout and make it conform smoothly to the screen width.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The starting exercise page is already responsive, but in a kind of crude way.  In Chrome's device-mode, check out the page at various widths and note how the spacing on the right side of the grid behaves.</li>
            <li>First off, in dev tools, figure out which style is controlling the width of the grid items.  Verify you have the right style by changing the value and seeing the impact.</li>
            <li>Let's make the grid fit it's container by using percentage-based widths.  We want to choose a width that is cleanly divisible into 100 so there is no gap on the right side.  Let's start with 25%.  Just make this change in Chrome for now.</li>
            <li>Goof around with the device width and see what happens.  What happens on narrower and wider screens?</li>
            <li>Four items per column is too many for our narrowest screens.  Let's make our mobile-first default a 2-item-per-row grid.  Go ahead and switch to your editor and make 50% the default width, save and reload.</li>
            <li>We really want this grid to work well at any width, so we are going to add some fine-grained breakpoints. Add a breakpoint for screens wider than 600px that switches to a 3-column layout. (Since 100/3 is 33.333333..., we will just use 33.333%)</li>
            <li>Add media queries for 4-column and 6-column layouts at screen widths that make sense to you.  Check your work in Chrome and go back and adjust the breakpoints until the transitions between layouts feel right.</li>
          </ol>

        <section>
          <p>Extra Credit</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Make minor adjustments to the font-size and grid item height at each breakpoint.  The general rule is, as screens get larger, noses get further away, so adjust slightly up at each breakpoint!</li>
            <li>Often, layouts feel out-of-proportion when they get too wide.  Give our <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> a <code>max-width</code> of 1200px.  Center it as well by adding <code>margin: 0 auto</code>.</li>
            <li>Difficulty: â™¦â™¦. Give the first item in each row a special background-color.  Use the <code>nth-child</code> selector (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child">background</a>).  Try to get the first-item-in-row highlight working at all the breakpoints.</li>
